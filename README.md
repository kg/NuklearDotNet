Squared.Render integration of the Nuklear immediate mode GUI. Based on NuklearDotNet.

No original nuklear source files were modified. A project was created with some support code 
to build Nuklear.dll (x64) with all API functions exported and ready to be used from .NET

Updating should be as easy as updating the submodule and rebuilding the project.

Contributions welcome.
